# Samaritan: A Voice-controlled Assistant for Endoscopy Surgeons

## What is Samaritan? 
Doctors often cannot write or type while assessing a patient. Samaritan is a voice-controlled assistant that transcribes and organizes clinical observations for doctors. 

The first version of Samaritan aims at facilitating a specific use-case -- endoscopic examinations. This procedure typically requires the endoscopy surgeon to use both hands, preventing them from recording notes.

## Future Work
In subsequent iterations, Samaritan aims to facilitate other parts of doctors' workflow. We believe that a voice-controlled assistant has huge potential because medical scribes are already being used for manual documentation tasks. Having an assistant provides numerous benefits for the doctor, such as improved efficiency and better patient interaction.
