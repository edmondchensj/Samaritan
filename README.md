# Samaritan: A Voice-controlled Assistant for Endoscopy Surgeons

## Introduction
Doctors often cannot write or type while assessing a patient. Samaritan is a voice-controlled assistant that transcribes and organizes clinical observations for a doctor. 

Samaritan has three benefits. It saves time for manual logging of clinical observations; it relieves doctors from memorizing observations by capturing them on-the-go; and for doctors who currently rely on hand-written notes, it helps them transition to digital records. 

The first version of Samaritan aims at facilitating a specific use-case -- endoscopic examinations. This procedure typically requires the endoscopy surgeon to use both hands, preventing them from recording notes.
