# Samaritan: A Voice-controlled Assistant for Endoscopy Surgeons

## What is Samaritan? 
Doctors often cannot write or type while assessing a patient. Samaritan is a voice-controlled assistant that transcribes and organizes clinical observations for doctors. 

The first version of Samaritan aims at facilitating a specific use-case -- endoscopic examinations. This procedure typically requires the endoscopy surgeon to use both hands, preventing them from recording notes.

## Benefits
Samaritan has three benefits. It saves time for manual logging of clinical observations; it relieves doctors from memorizing observations by capturing them on-the-go; and for doctors who currently rely on hand-written notes, it helps them transition to digital records. 

## Business Model
The system uses a subscription model with a free tier. This model allows doctors to try our system at essentially zero cost. Since Samaritan is deployed as a web application, the only requirement is downloading our microphone-enabled mobile app. 

## Future Work
In subsequent iterations, Samaritan aims to facilitate other parts of doctors' workflow. We believe that a voice-controlled assistant has huge potential because medical scribes are increasingly being used for manual documentation tasks. Having an assistant provides numerous benefits for the doctor, such as improved efficiency and better patient interaction.
